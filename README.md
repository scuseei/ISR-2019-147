## Online Supplementary for ISR-2019-147

### Raw Dataset
The raw dataset is made up of three components. For each individual, we observe (1) her online browsing trajectories, that is, what she has seen online (through both the PC and mobile channels) in terms of uniform resource locators (URLs) with timestamps; (2) her offline travel trajectory, that is, where she has been, in terms of geographical trajectories with timestamps; (3) demographics and weather variables.

The online browsing trajectory data looks like this (subject to the NDA, we can only disclose a snippet of data):

The offline geolocation trajectory data can be visualized (again, subject to the NDA, we can only disclose a snippet of data):
